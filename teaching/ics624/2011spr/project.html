<h1>ICS 624 Course Project (100pts) </h1>

<ul>
<li>Since there are no exams in this course, the course project should be a
substantial research-oriented project. 
</li>
<li>The course project should be an individual project. However, students can
form groups to work on more ambitious projects, but each member must be working
on a substantial piece.
</li>
<li>
You should aim for the project to be 
publishable as a workshop/poster/demo paper in a reputable conference. 
</li>
<li>
You are free to propose your own projects in your area of interest as long as
there is a clear data management or data processing aspect.
You may also work on a "canned" project predefined by the instructor (TBA).
</li>
<li>
Projects should have a significant implementation and experimentation component or a significant theoretical analysis component.
</li>
<li>
Projects should contribute something new to the existing body of knowledge. Hence a literature review will be necessary to summarize the relationship of the project with prior work.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Milestones and Deliverables</h2>

<ul>
<li>Project Proposal</li>
<li>Project Progress Report</li>
<li>Project Presentation </li>
<li>Project Write-Up</li>
</ul>

Check the course schedule on the course website for due dates of the various milestones. The project proposal dateline is meant to help you start thinking about the project early. Your project can continue to evolve and change after the project proposal dateline.

<p/>
<b>Proposals</b> should be posted in Laulima/Discussion List/Class Discussion and the title should be prefixed with "<i>Proposal:</i>". The proposal should contain the following sections:
<ul>
<li>Members: list of names of students working on the project</li>
<li>Research question: a brief and succinct statement on what research question 
the project aims to answer</li>
<li>Statement of work: a short paragraph describing of how you plan to address the research question or problem.</li>
<li>Timeline: list major milestones and checkpoints. A fortnightly schedule would be nice.</li>
</ul>
Again, the proposal is an exercise to help you plan your work. While what
actually happens may well be very different, try to be as honest and as
realistic as possible in the plan.

<p/>
You are not required to turn in code, but be prepared to show any code you
wrote, should the instructor request for it for the purpose of grading.  The
grading of the projects will be based on the following criteria:
<ul>
<li>Novelty of the research problem and the proposed solution.</li>
<li>Quality of analysis and evaluation (theoretical or empirical).</li>
<li>Amount of work/effort put into the project. </li>
<li>Relevance to data management research. </li>
<li>Presentation quality (clarity,enthusiasm, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Peer Evaluation of Projects</h2>

You are encouraged to evaluate the project of your peers critically but
constructively. You will receive TBD percentage points as extra credit towards
your course grade for every evaluation that you submit<br>

<h2>A Few Pre-defined Projects</h2>

<ul>
<li>Optimizing Access Across Multiple Hierarchies in Data Warehouses (Journal Paper)</li>
<li>Join Compression</li>
<li>Semantic Queries for Scientific Applications</li>
<li>Fast RDF Path Statistics</li>
<li>Energy Efficient Complex Event Processing</li>
<li>Streaming System for Wind Energy Optimization</li>
<li>Elastic SQL Processing for Scientific Applications</li>
</ul>
