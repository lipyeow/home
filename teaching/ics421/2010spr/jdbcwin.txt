Instructions for Setting up JDK and JDBC on Windows Platform
=============================================================

1. If you do not have JDK installed, please download JDK from 

http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/widget/jdk6.jsp

and install it. Note the installation path for the jdk. On my Vista box it
installed into "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_18"

2. Add the path to javac to your PATH environment variable. You can edit your
environment variable by StartMenu->Control Panel->Classic
View->System->Advanced

On my Vista box the path is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_18\bin"

3. Open a command window. Goto the directory where the JDBC sample code is.

4. Compile the code by typing:

javac *.java

5. Edit the properties file per instruction in Task description and run the
program using:

java -cp path/to/db2jcc.jar;. runquery -q q1.clp

the db2jcc file is usually located in program files\ibm\db2\sqllib\java
directory

you shouldn't get any class not found errors.

Make sure that your db2 instance is started up.

Eclipse IDE
------------

if you are using the eclipse IDE, you can add the db2jcc.jar
by clicking on the project. Right click to bring up menu.
Click on properties. In the properties dialog box, hit the
libraries tab, and add external library button.
