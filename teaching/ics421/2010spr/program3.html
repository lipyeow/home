<h1>ICS 421 - Spring 2010 - Programming Assignment 3</h1>

<hr/>
<p>Updated Mar 22 to fix localnode.driver.
<p>Updated Mar 12 to include policy on grammar sharing.
<p>Updated Mar 12 to include temporary table information.
<hr/>

<p>
You may work in a team of two students, but each student needs to make a
submission. You are encouraged to engage in general discussions with other
teams regarding the assignment, but specific details of a solution, including
the solution itself, must always be the team's own work. You may submit the same
code as the rest of your team.

<h2>Part 5: Distributed SQL Processor Supporting Joins (100 pts)</h2>

Modify your code from Part 3 (<tt>runSQL</tt>) to support select-from-where
queries involving joins between exactly two tables. The two tables to be joined
may be distributed tables with fragments residing on multiple nodes.
The input to <tt>runSQL</tt> consists of two filenames
(stored in variables <tt>clustercfg</tt> and <tt>sqlfile</tt>) passed in
as commandline arguments. The file <tt>clustercfg</tt> contains
access information for the catalog DB. The file <tt>sqlfile</tt> contains the
SQL terminated by a semi-colon to be executed.  
The join query needs to be executed on multiple threads; However, you should
develop the sequential non-multi-threaded version first. Guidance will be
provided on how to convert the join QEP into a multi-threaded one.

<p><tt>runSQL</tt> should output the rows retrieved to the
standard output on success or report failure.

<p>You may assumed that the SQL queries only operate on
at most two tables and do not contain any nested subqueries.

<p>You should consider using the ANTLR compiler compiler to generate a SQL
parser that you can use to extract the table names and to detect the join
conditions. Only equi-joins need to be supported.

<p><b>Policy on grammar sharing</b>
You may discuss, share, and/or develop the grammar with other groups.

<p>
You may test your program on a single computer by using
different databases to simulate the multiple computers.

<hr/>
<h3>Sample contents of a <tt>clustercfg</tt> file</h3>
<ul>
<pre>
catalog.driver=com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver
catalog.hostname=jdbc:db2://10.0.0.3:50001/mycatdb
catalog.username=db2inst1
catalog.passwd=mypasswd

localnode.driver=com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver
localnode.hostname=jdbc:db2://10.0.0.3:50001/mydb1
localnode.username=db2inst1
localnode.passwd=mypasswd

</pre>
</ul>

localnode identifies the node in the cluster that received the query and that
will co-ordinate the execution of the query. 

<hr/>

<h3>Sample contents of a <tt>sqlfile</tt> file</h3>
<ul>
<pre>
SELECT S.sname 
FROM Sailors S, Reserves R
WHERE S.sid=R.sid and R.day='2009-12-21'
;
</pre>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h3>Sample Output of <tt>`./run3.sh ./cluster.cfg ./sailors.sql`</tt></h3>
<ul>
<pre>
Ramakrishnan
Silberstein
[jdbc:db2://10.0.0.3:50001/mydb2]: ./sailors.sql success.
[jdbc:db2://10.0.0.3:50001/mydb1]: ./sailors.sql failed.
</pre>
</ul>

<p>It is recommended that you develop your program in the following steps
<ul>
<li>Focus on the distributed join algorithm first. Assume no multi-threading,
no projection or additional selection operators in the QEP. </li>

<li>Once the
distributed join algorithm is implemented and tested, work on incorporating
projection.</li> 

<li>Next incorporate additional filtering predicates (ie selection operators) from the where-clause </li> 

<li>Keep in mind to pushdown predicates/selections and projections as much as possible.</li> 

<li>Convert the join operation to a multi-threaded version by assigning each join between two fragments to a thread.</li>

</ul>

<hr/>

You may need to use temporary tables for your joins. On DB2 you will need to use the following statement: <a href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9/topic/com.ibm.db2.udb.admin.doc/doc/r0003272.htm?resultof=%22%63%72%65%61%74%65%22%20%22%63%72%65%61%74%22%20%22%74%65%6d%70%6f%72%61%72%79%22%20%22%74%65%6d%70%6f%72%61%72%69%22%20%22%74%61%62%6c%65%22%20%22%74%61%62%6c%22%20">DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE</a>.

<hr/>

<h2>General Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>You may program in any of the following languages: Java, C/C++, PHP, Python, Perl.</li> 

<li>You are encouraged to use ANTLR to generate the code to parse SQL statements as well as to parse the CSV file. It will save you a lot of time.</li> 

<li>You may use any third party libraries, but you need to provide them, so that your program is executable on the submission machine.</li> 

<li>Your code should minimally support select-from-where statements</li>

<li>Your code should minimally work with DB2 Express C DBMS instances.</li> 

<li>You should ensure that your code is well commented and readable.</li>

<li>You should develop the code on your own computer. In order for you to
receive credit for the assignment, your code must to be compilable and
executable on a linux machine. (A linux box will be provided for you to test
your code for compliance.) 
</li>

<li>You must provide two shell scripts <tt>compile.sh</tt> and <tt>run.sh</tt>
to compile and run your code respectively. The script <tt>run.sh</tt> should
take <tt>clustercfg</tt> and <tt>sqlfile</tt> as its 1st and 2nd commandline
arguments</li>

</ul>

<h2>Submission Procedure</h2>

<p>Submit:
<ul>
<li>One set of source files for Part 5</li>
<li>compile5.sh and run5.sh for Part 5</li>
<li>submission of grammar file is optional but recommended, you may just submit the generated files</li>
</ul>

<p>antlrworks.jar is installed in /home/db2inst1/lib/antlrworks.jar  on the submission machine</p>

<p>Follow the <a href="programsub.html">Submission Procedure</a>
