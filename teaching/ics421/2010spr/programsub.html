<h1>Submission Procedure for Programming Assignments</h1>
<ul>
<li>SSH/Login to the submission machine:
   <ul>
      ec2-174-129-49-13.compute-1.amazonaws.com
   </ul>
Username and passwork has been sent out via a class email. 
</li>
<li>CD into the ics421 directory. </li>
<li>Create a subdirectory for yourself using your UH email
ID (without the at hawaii.edu).</li> 
<li>CD into your directory.</li>
<li>Create a subdirectory called <tt>programN</tt>, substitute N with the assignment number..
If you are submitting the same code as your team member, you may create a symbolic link instead of a real subdirectory.
</li>
<li>Upload your code to that directory using a secure FTP client. For example
if your email is blue at hawaii dot edu, and you are submitting code for
Assignment 1, your code should be uploaded to
   <ul>
   <tt>~/ics421/blue/program1/</tt> directory.
   </ul>
</li>
<li>Create a shell script compile.sh that would compile your
code. A sample is given in the
<tt>~/ics421/lipyeow/program1</tt> directory. You just need
to change the paths and source file list.
</li> 
<li>Create a shell script run.sh that would execute your
program. A sample is given in the
<tt>~/ics421/lipyeow/program1</tt> directory. You just need
to change the paths and source file list.
</li> 
<li>
Create a text file <tt>team.txt</tt> that contains the UH
email ID (without the at hawaii.edu) of the team members,
one member per line. 
</li>
<li>
Edit the text files in linux. If you download the compile.sh and run.sh to a windows machine and edit it and upload it, you introduce windows style line feeds which confuses the linux shell.
</li>
</li>
Run the checksubmissionN (replace N with the assignment number) from your submission directory (/home/db2inst1/ics421/<userid>/programN/) to check your submission.
<li>
</ul>

<h2>Unix Commands you might need</h2>

<ul>
<li> <tt>man [commandname]</tt>: show the manual page of a command.
</li> 
<li> <tt>cd</tt>: change directory.
</li>
<li> <tt>ls</tt>: list directory.
</li>
<li> <tt>cp</tt>: copy files from src to target path.
</li>
<li> <tt>rm</tt>: remove files.
</li> 
<li> <tt>jpico</tt>: a relatively easy to use editor.
</li> 
<li> <tt>chmod u+x [file]</tt>: add execution permission for user to file.
</li> 
</ul>
