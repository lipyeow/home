Outline of One Possible Solution to Programming Assignment 1.
=============================================================
Note that other designs are possible, the critical thing is
to understand the tradeoffs. This outline only lists the
high level steps, it does not structure the code nicely into
objects/subroutines etc.
=============================================================

connlist : array of connections
rclist   : array of return codes
tlist    : array of threads

Read config file and ddl file

Parse ddl to get ddltype and table name

open connection to catalog db

if ddltype == CREATE TABLE, then

   foreach node n, connlist[n] = open connection using config file info.

   foreach node n, tlist[n] = runThread (ddl, rclist, n)

   Wait for each thread to finish

   foreach node n 
     
      check rclist[n] and output success or failure

      if success, update catalog db to insert entry for node n   

else if ddltype == DROP TABLE, then

   query catalog db for node & connection info for given table name

   foreach node n, connlist[n] = open connection.

   foreach node n, tlist[n] = runThread (ddl, rclist, n)

   Wait for each thread to finish

   foreach node n 
     
      check rclist[n] and output success or failure

      if success, update catalog db to remove entry for given table name for node n.  

close all node and catalog connections

perform other clean up
