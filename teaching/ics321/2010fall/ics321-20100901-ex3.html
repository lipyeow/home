<h1>Exercise 2.3.1 (Database Systems: The Complete Book)</h1>

<p>
In this exercise we introduce one
of our running examples of a relational database schema.
The database schema consists of four relations, whose
schemas are: 
<ul>
<li> Product ( maker, model, type ) </li>
<li> PC ( model, speed, ram, hd, price ) </li>
<li> Laptop ( model, speed, ram, hd, screen, price ) </li>
<li> Printer ( model, color, type, price )</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Product relation gives the manufacturer, model number
and type ( PC, laptop, or printer ) of various products.
We assume for convenience that model numbers are unique over
all manufacturers and product types ; that assumption is not
realistic, and a real database would include a code for the
manufacturer as part of the model number. The PC relation
gives for each model number that is a PC the speed ( of the
processor, in gigahertz ), the amount of RAM ( in
megabytes ), the size of the hard disk ( in gigabytes ),
and the price. The Laptop relation is similar, except that
the screen size ( in inches ) is also included. The Printer
relation records for each printer model whether the printer
produces color output ( true, if so ), the process type (
laser or ink - jet, typically ), and the price. 

<h3>Task 1</h3>
<p>
Write the following declarations : 
<ul>
<li>a ) A suitable schema for relation Product.  </li>
<li>b ) A suitable schema for relation PC. </li>
<li>c ) A suitable schema for relation Laptop. </li>
<li>d ) A suitable schema for relation Printer. </li>
<li>e ) An alteration to your Printer schema from ( d ) to
delete the attribute color. </li>
<li>f ) An alteration to your Laptop schema from ( c ) to add
the attribute od ( optical - disk type, e. g., cd or dvd
).  Let the default value for this attribute be ' none ' if
the laptop does not have an optical disk. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Task 2</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>a) Create a database in DB2 ( CREATE DB <i>dbname</i> )</li>
<li>b) Create tables in your database by inputing your SQL declarations into
DB2</li>
<li>c) Insert several tuples into the tables you have created</li>
<li>d) Check your work by issuing a simple SQL query</li>
</ul>
