<h1>ICS 321 Course Project (100pts) </h1>

The goal of the course project is to 
<ul>
<li>(1) implement an application that uses a
DBMS,
</li>
<li> (2) investigate and evaluate design choices made in the course of
implementing the application.
</li>
</ul>
You are free to choose an application domain of your choice (the application can be related to your work or interests).  
A web-based interface is not essential to the course project, but might be helpful.

<h2>Your Tasks</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Form a group of 3 students. It would be wise to consider the schedule and interests of group members. Exceptions may be given for single person projects under special circumstances.
You could use Laulima->Discussion List->Student Lounge to find groups/members
</li>
<li>
Pick a database-intensive application to implement. Discuss what features are required and what software is needed to implement the application.
</li>
<li> Write a brief project proposal and post it in
Laulima->Class Discussion with "Project:" as a prefix in the title. Your proposal should include:
   <ul>
   <li> Project Title </li>
   <li>Group name and members.
   Assign one person as the group representative
   </li>
   <li> Short description of the application including critical features and design choices you plan to investigate.
   </li>
   <li>A brief timeline with milestones
   </li>
   <li>Ideally you should have an idea who is doing what
   </li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li>
Do the project. 
   <ul>
   <li> Think about how you could evaluate the design choices experimentally
and quantitatively. 
   </li>
   <li> Generate data and run experiments to evaluate the design alternatives.
   </li>
   <li> Analyze the measurements obtained from your experiments and present them in an easy-to-understand way.
   </li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li>
Post a progress report in Laulima->Class Discussions. These reports are meant
to make sure that you're on the schedule you've set for yourselves. They should
be short, and state what you have accomplished so far (w.r.t. the schedule),
what unexpected obstacles you have encountered. In some cases, we may have to
revise the project plans as a result of the midterm reports.  </li>
<li>
Prepare a short 8 min presentation and/or demo and optionally record it as a screencast using sceencast-o-matic.
</li>
<li>
Present your project either <b>live</b> in person OR using a <b>screencast</b> in class and be prepared to answer questions.
</li>
<li>
Participate in peer evaluation of projects.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deliverables </h2>

<ul>
<li> 
Project proposal (10 pts) due Oct 18 2011 2359 hours
</li>
<li> 
Project progress report (10 pts) due Nov 14 2011 2359 hours
</li>
<li> 
Project presentation (80 pts)
</li>
</ul>
You are not required to turn in code, but be prepared to show any code you wrote, should the instructor request for it for the purpose of grading.
The grading of the projects will be based on the following criteria:
<ul>
<li>Quality of analysis of the different alternatives.</li>
<li>Amount of work/effort put into the project. </li>
<li>Relevance to learning database systems. </li>
<li>Presentation quality (clarity,enthusiasm, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Evaluation of Peer Projects</h2>

You are encouraged to evaluate the project of your peers critically but
constructively. You will receive 0.25 percentage points as extra credit towards
your course grade for every evaluation that you submit to:<br>
<ul>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/a/hawaii.edu/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEt2ejRsUmNXZjc3V0xmbWlFaUU4OGc6MQ">Project Peer Evaluation Form</a>
</ul>
The peer evaluation consists of 5 questions:
<ul>
<li>The presentation is clear and understandable.</li>
<li>I learned something new from the presentation.</li>
<li>The group/individual put in a lot of effort and work for the project. </li>
<li>What did you like best about this project? </li>
<li>What could be improved in this project? </li>
</ul>
