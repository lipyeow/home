Here, O my Lord, I  see thee face to face (Key: C, Chords: C F G Am A Dm)

C     *    *     Am Dm       G       C  *
1. Here, O my Lord, I  see thee face to face;
C    G       F     C   Dm     F        G  *    
here would I touch and handle things unseen;
C    *          *  *   F     A      Dm *
here grasp with firmer hand eternal grace,
Dm  G      C    F     C   G    C  *
and all my weariness upon thee lean.

   C    *      *    Am Dm      G      C  *
2. This is the hour of banquet and of song;
C    G      F     C  Dm    F          G  *    
this is the heavenly table spread for me;
C    *      *      *   F         A        Dm *
here let me feast, and feasting, still prolong
Dm  G        C       F     C    G    C  *
the hallowed hour of fellowship with thee.

   C    *       *    Am Dm     G        C  *
3. Here would I feed up-on the bread of God,
C    G          F    C   Dm    F       G  *    
here drink with thee the royal wine of heaven;
C    *       *   * F         A       Dm *
here would I lay a-side each earthly load,
Dm   G       C         F       C   G  C  *
here taste a-fresh the calm of sin forgiven.

   C   *       *     Am  Dm      G     C  *
4. Too soon we rise; the symbols disap-pear;
C   G             F   C   Dm       F        G  *    
the feast, though not the love, is past and gone.
C   *         *    *  F         A        Dm *
The bread and wine re-move; but thou art here,
Dm  G        C     F        C      G   C  *
nea-rer than ever, still my shield and sun.

   C     *     *     Am   Dm        G      C  *
5. Feast after feast thus comes and passes by;
C    G        F      C  Dm       F       G  *    
yet, passing, points to the glad feast a-bove,
C  *          *   *     F      A      Dm *
gi-ving sweet foretaste of the festal joy,
Dm  G            C      F        C     G   C  *
the Lamb's great bridal feast of bliss and love.
