1 A mighty fortress is our God, a  bulwark never fai--ling;
C   C  *   G   * Am  *   G      Am Em(F)  C   (Am)Dm(G)C
Our helper He, a-mid the flood, of mortal ills prevai--ling:
C   G     Am  G D     G * *     C    G    *  F    *  Am * *
For still our ancient foe,      Doth seek to work us woe;  
E   Am   (E)  A    (D)  G * *   F    F     F    A  Dm E * *
His craft and power are great,  And, armed with cruel hate,
Am Em   (F) C  (Am) Dm G C
On earth is not his e----qual. 

      C  *  G   *   Am       D  G     Am  Em (F)   C    (Am)Dm(G)C
2 Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing,
*    C   *   G     *   Am *   G       Am  Em (F) C    (Am) Dm(G)C
were not the right Man on our side,   the Man of God's own choo-sing.
C   G   Am  G    D   G * *  C      G *    F  *  Am * *
You ask who that may be?    Christ Jesus, it is he;   
E    Am(E)  A (D)  G * *    F    F   F  A   Dm  E * *
Lord Sa-ba-oth his name,    from age to age the same;
Am  Em(F)   C  (Am) Dm G  C
and he must win the b-a-t-tle.

      C   *    G      *    Am D    G       Am     Em  (F)  C (Am)Dm (G)C
3 And tho this world, with de-vils filled, should threaten to un-do-us,
*  C    *   G     *   Am  *   G      Am  Em   (F) C (Am)  Dm (G)  C
we will not fear, for God has willed his truth to triumph through us.
C   G      Am G  D     G * *  C  G   *   F   *   Am * *
The prince of darkness grim,  we tremble not for him;   
E   Am  (E) A  (D)G * *       F   F   F   A    Dm E * *
his rage we can endure,       for lo! his doom is sure;
Am  Em(F)  C   (Am)   Dm G  C
one little word shall fe-ll him.

       C    * G    *   Am   D  G       Am Em     (F)C   (Am)Dm(G)C
4 That Word a-bove all earthly powers; no thanks to them a--bi---deth;
C   C  *   G   *   Am    *   G      Am      Em (F)  C   (Am)Dm(G)C
the Spirit and the gifts are ours   through him who with us si---deth.
C   G     Am  G  D    G * *  C    G  *   F    *  Am * *
Let goods and kindred go,    this mortal life al-so;    
E   Am(E) A   (D)  G * *     F     F     F A Dm   E * *
the bo-dy they may kill:     God's truth a-bideth still;
Am  Em (F)  C  (Am)Dm G C
his kingdom is for-e----ver
