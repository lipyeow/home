Sent forth by God's blessing, our true faith confessing,
    G         C             D             G       
The people of God from this dwelling take leave.
    G          *        Am       D      
The service is ended, O now be extended

The fruits of our worship in all who believe.

        G           D           *             G         
    The seed of the teaching, receptive souls reaching,

    Shall blossom in action for God and for all.

God's grace did invite us, and love shall unite us,

To work for God's kingdom and answer the call.

With praise and thanks-giving to God, ever-living,

The tasks of our everyday life we will face,

Our faith ever sharing, in love ever caring, 
  G             C           D              G    
Embracing God's children of each tribe and race.

         G              D             *              G        
    With your grace you feed us, with your light now lead us;
      G          C          A            D    
    U-nite us as one in the life that we share.

     G           *            Am                D       
Then may all the living, with praise and thanks-giving
     G         C               D             G   
Give honour to Christ and that name which we bear.
