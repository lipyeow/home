C              *    F  *
Crown Him with many crowns
    C     F       G  *
The Lamb upon His throne
     C       Am       D      G  *
Hark how the heav'nly anthem drowns 
    G     D       G  *
All music but its own
 C        *         F  *
Awake, my soul, and sing 
   D       *        G  *
Of Him who died for thee
    C        F      G         C
And hail Him as thy matchless King 
        F     G      C *
Through all e-ter–ni-ty
 
C             *       F   *
Crown Him the Lord of life
    C         F        G  *
Who triumphed o’er the grave
    C       Am      D      G
And rose victorious in the strife
    G        D        G   *
For those He came  to save
    C       *      F   *
His glories now we sing
    D        *       G 
Who died and rose on high
    C     F      G       C  
Who died eternal life to bring
    F          G         C  *  
And lives that death may die
 
C             *       F   *
Crown Him the Lord of peace
      C       F       G   *
Whose power a scepter sways
     C       Am         D        G   
From pole to pole, that wars may cease
    G      D          G   *
And all be prayer and praise
    C           *       F  *
His reign shall know no end
    D         *       G  * 
And round His pierced feet
     C          F     G      C
Fair flowers of par-a-dise extend    
      F         G    C   *
Their fragrance ever sweet.
 
C             *       F  *
Crown Him the Lord of love
  C        F         G   *
Behold His hands and side
      C          Am   D   G  
Those wounds yet visi-ble above 
   G      D      G  *
In beauty glor-i-fied
    C      *       F  *
All hail Redeemer, hail
    D         *        G *
For Thou hast died for me
    C          F     G         C  
Thy praise and glory shall not fail
        F    G     C  *
Through-out eter-nity
