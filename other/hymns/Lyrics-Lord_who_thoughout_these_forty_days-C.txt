     C          F         Am    F
Lord who throughout these forty days
    C        Dm       G
For us didst fast and pray
      Am      Em      F         G      
Teach us with Thee to mourn our sins
    Am       F       C
And close by Thee to stay

   C         F     Am       F
As Thou with Satan didst contend
    C         Dm      G
And didst the victory win
  Am      Em          F       G      
O give us strength in Thee to fight
   Am      F       C
In Thee to conquer sin

   C          F      Am       F
As Thou didst hunger bear and thirst
   C        Dm       G
So teach us gracious Lord
   Am     Em       F       G      
To die to self and chiefly live
   Am       F    C
By Thy most holy word

    C             F       Am  F
And through these days of penitence
    C           Dm     G
And through Thy passiontide
    Am  Em      F        G      
Yea evermore in life and death
  Am       F   C
Jesus with us abide

 C         F       Am      F
Abide with us that so this life
   C         Dm   G
Of suffering over past
   Am     Em   F      G      
An Easter of unending joy
   Am    F       C
We may attain at last
