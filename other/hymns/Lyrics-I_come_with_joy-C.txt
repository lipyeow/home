forgiven, loved, and free;

in awe and wonder to recall

his life laid down for me, his life laid down for me.

to find, as all are fed,

the new com-munity of love

3. As Christ breaks bread and bids us share,

each proud di-vision ends;
    F         G        Em       Am   
the love that made us, makes us one,
    Dm        *       F *          G         Dm      C *
and strangers now are friends, and strangers now are friends.

his presence, always near,
   F       G          Em     Am   
is in such friendship better known:
   Dm      *          F *      G       Dm         C *
we see and praise him here, we see and praise him here.

     C      F       G      C
5. Together met, to-gether bound,
      C      F         G  *
we'll go our different ways;
    F      G      Em     Am   
and as his people in the world,
      Dm       *         F *           G        Dm        C *
we'll live and speak his praise, we'll live and speak his praise.
