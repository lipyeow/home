1. Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
     D        *      A        *
That calls me from a world of care,
    D       *     G         *
And bids me at my Fa-ther’s throne,
     D      *         A      D
Make all my wants and wishes known
   D        G      D         *
In sea-sons of dis-tress and grief,
   D        G     D        A7
My soul has often found re-lief,
    D     *         G         *
And oft escaped the tempter’s snare,
   D     *           A       D
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer.

         D       *             G       *
2. Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer! 
    D      *         A       *
the joys I feel, the bliss I share 
   D           *       G       *
of those whose anxious spirits burn 
     D        *         A     D
with strong desires for thy return! 
     D      G      D      *
With such I hasten to the place 
      D      G      D         A7
where God my Savior shows his face, 
    D      *       G       *
and gladly take my station there, 
    D        *           A       D
and wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer! 

         D       *             G       *
3. Sweet hour of pray’r, sweet hour of prayer,
    D           *     A       *
Thy wings shall my pe-ti-tion bear
   D         *         G         *
To him whose truth and faith-ful-ness
   D        *        A7      D
En-gage the wait-ing soul to bless
    D        G       D        *
And since he bids me seek his face,
  D         G         D         A7
Believe his word, and trust his grace,
     D       D      G      *
I’ll cast on him my ev-ery care,
    D        *           A       D
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.
