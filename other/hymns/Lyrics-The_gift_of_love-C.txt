       C     * *  F      *       C  * *
Though I may speak  with bravest fire,
    C        Am * Dm   *     G * *
and have the gift   to all inspire,
    G        C *  Dm   *         C * Dm
and have not love,  my words are vain;
   Dm       G  *  F     *        C * *
as sounding brass,  and hopeless gain.

       C     * *  F      *   C  * *
Though I may give    all I possess,
    C        Am * Dm    *       G * *
and striving so      my love profess,
    G      C *    Dm   *      C * Dm
but not be given     by love within,
    Dm     G *    F      *         C * *
the profit soon      turns strangely thin.
 
      C       * *  F     *         C * *
Come, Spirit, come,  our hearts control,
    C       Am * Dm   *       G * *
our spirits long   to be made whole.
    G      C *   Dm      *     C * Dm
Let inward love    guide every deed;
   Dm      G *   F       *       C * *
by this we wor-   -ship, and are freed.
