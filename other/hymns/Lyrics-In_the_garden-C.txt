6 1    2  3   4  5   6 1 
  C           *       *  *
I come to the garden alone
          F      *            C *
While the dew is still on the roses
        G       *             Am7     C
And the voice I hear, falling on my   ear
    D      *      G   G7
The Son of God discloses
           C          *
    And He walks with me
           G          *
    And He talks with me
           Dm       *        C9
    And He tells me I am His own
            C      E           Am   F
    And the joy we share as we tarry there
         C         G    C
    None other has ever known
     
      C              *            *  *
2. He speaks and the sound of His voice
      F         *                C *
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing
        G   *          Am7     C
And the melody that He gave to me
  D       *        G  G7
Within my heart is ringing
           C          *
    And He walks with me
           G          *
    And He talks with me
           Dm       *        C9
    And He tells me I am His own
            C      E           Am   F
    And the joy we share as we tarry there
         C         G    C
    None other has ever known
 
       C           *           *  *
3. I'd stay in the garden with Him
           F      *           C *
Though the night around me be falling
       G       *              Am7      C
But He bids me go through the voice of woe
    D        *     G  G7
His voice to me is calling
  
           C          *
    And He walks with me
           G          *
    And He talks with me
           Dm       *        C9
    And He tells me I am His own
            C      E           Am   F
    And the joy we share as we tarry there
         C         G    C
    None other has ever known
