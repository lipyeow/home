and sing the love amazing

that songs cannot repay;

for we can only wonder
C  G *   C        F   *
at ev'ry gift you send,

2 The flow'r of earthly splendor
Em F         *   G  Am  *
in time must surely die,
C   F    *  G        C  *
its fragile bloom surrender
Em   F      *    G    C   *
to you, the Lord Most High;

C   G *    Am       G  *
but hidden from all nature
C    G *    C       F   *
the eternal seed is sown--
F      Am  *    G      C  *
though small in mortal stature,
C  F        *  *   G   *
to heaven's garden grown:

C   F  *         G         C  *
for Christ, your gift from heaven,
Em   F         *   G  Am  *
from death has set us free,
C   F *        G       C  *
and we through him are given
Em  F     *  G C *
the final victory.


  C    F   *   G        C   *
3 Then hear, O gracious Savior,
Em F       *    G  Am  *
accept the love we bring,
C    F    * G         C  *
that we who know your favor
Em  F         *  G   C   *
may serve you as our King;

C   G *     Am    G  *
and whether our tomorrows
C  G  *        C       F   *
be filled with good or ill,
F     Am *    G           C  *
we'll triumph through our sorrows
C   F       *     *   G   *
and rise to bless you still:

C  F *    G       C  *
to marvel at your beauty
Em  F     *  G    Am  *
and glory in your ways,
C   F *    G      C  *
and make a joyful duty
Em  F    *    G  C  *
our sacrifice of praise.
