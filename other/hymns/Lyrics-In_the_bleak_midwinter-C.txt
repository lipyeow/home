In the bleak midwinter (Key: C. Chords: C F G Am Dm)

C      *         Am *    F      *         G  *
In the bleak mid-winter, frosty wind made moan,
C           *       Am *  F     G      C *
Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;
Dm       *       Am      *     C    F  G *
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,
C      *         Am *    F  G   C *
In the bleak mid-winter, lo-ng ago.
 
    C           *      Am   *    F   *        G *
Our God, Heav'n cannot hold him, nor earth sustain;
C          *           Am    *   F       G        C  *
Heav'n and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign.
Dm     *        Am *     C      F        G *
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
    C    *     Am  *   F G     C  *
The Lord God almighty, Je--sus Christ.
 
C      *        Am *    F        *        G *
Angels and Arch-an-gels may have gathered there,
C    *       Am  *    F   G         C  *
Cherubim and seraphim thro-nged the air;
Dm      *      Am *   C      F      G *
But his mother on-ly, in her maiden bliss,
C         *     Am *   F G    C  *
Worshiped the belo-ved with a kiss.
 
C    *     Am   *    F    *    G *
What can I give him, poor as I am?
C    *      Am *      F       G       C  *
If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;
Dm   *      Am   *    C       F     G *
If I were a wise man, I would do my part;
    C      *     Am   *    F  G    C  *
Yet what I can I give him: give my heart.
