O sacred Head now wounded (Key: C. Chords: C F G Am Dm E D)

     F      Dm        G    C
1. O sacred Head, now wounded,
     Am        E             Am
With grief and shame weighed down,
    F       Dm G       C
Now scornfully surrounded
     Am            E    Am
With thorns, Thine only crown
    G         F        C  *
How pale thou art with anguish,
     F    Dm        Am
with sore abuse and scorn.
    G         C      D G
How does that visage languish
      F        G         Am
which once was bright as morn.

        F        Dm         G  C
2. What Thou, my Lord, hast suffered,
      Am      E        Am
T'was all for sinners’ gain;
      F        Dm       G   C
Mine, mine was the transgression,
    Am        E      Am
But Thine the deadly pain.
    G      F        C  *
Lo, here I fall, my Saviour.
     F    Dm       Am
‘Tis I deserve Thy place;
     G     C        D G
Look on me with Thy favour,
     F       G      Am
Vouchsafe to me Thy grace.

        F        Dm      G  C
3. What language shall I borrow
   Am          E       Am
to thank thee, dearest Friend,
    F         Dm    G  C
for this, thy dying sorrow,
    Am   E       Am
thy pity without end?
    G       F       C  *
Oh, make me thine forever,
    F        Dm       Am
and should I fainting be,
      G      C      D G
Lord, let me never, never
   F       G       Am
outlive my love to thee.

     F         Dm   G  C
4 Be near when I am dying,
    Am       E        Am
oh, show thy cross to me,
    F      Dm      G C
and for my rescue, flying,
      Am        E      Am
come, Lord, and set me free!
      G         F       C  *
These eyes, new faith receiving,
     F     Dm        Am
from Jesus shall not move,
    G       C      D  G
for one who dies believing
     F       G           C
dies safely, through thy love.
