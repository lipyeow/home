Hail to the Lord's Anointed (Ellacombe. Key: C. Chords: C F G Am)

        C      G       Am  G
1. Hail to the Lord's Anointed,
      F       G       C  *
great David's greater Son!
     C      G      Am  G
Hail in the time appointed,
    F        G       C  *
his reign on earth begun!
   C        *       G   *
He comes to break oppression,
   C       *       G  *
to set the captive free;
   C     G        Am  G
to take away transgression,
    F       G   C  *
and rule in equity.

      C          G      Am  G
2. He comes with succor speedy
   F         G      C  *
to those who suffer wrong;
   C        G        Am  G
to help the poor and needy,
    F       G       C  *
and bid the weak be strong;
   C         *         G   *
to give them songs for sighing,
      C        *       G  *
their darkness turn to light,
      C         G          Am  G
whose souls, condemned and dying,
    F        G      C  *
are precious in his sight.

      C          G         Am  G
3. He shall come down like showers
 F       G        C  *
upon the fruitful earth;
      C        G          Am  G
love, joy, and hope, like flowers,
       F      G       C  *
spring in his path to birth.
   C        *     G   *
Before him on the mountains,
      C          *       G  *
shall peace, the herald, go,
    C         G       Am  G
and righteousness, in fountains,
     F       G      C  *
from hill to valley flow.

      C         G        Am  G
4. To him shall prayer unceasing
    F     G      C  *
and daily vows ascend;
    C       G       Am  G
his kingdom still increasing,
  F       G       C  *
a kingdom without end.
    C       *          G   *
The tide of time shall never
    C   *      G  *
his covenant remove;
    C          G       Am  G
his name shall stand forever;
     F       G     C  *
that name to us is love.
