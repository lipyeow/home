Blackbird has spoken like the first bird.

Praise for the singing! Praise for the morning!

Praise for them, springing fresh from the Word!

Am             Em  F    Em           Dm  G
Like the first dew fall on the first grass.

Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden,
G            C    F    G              C * 
Sprung in completeness where his feet pass.

Born of the one light Eden saw play.

Praise with elation, praise every morning,
G            C F    G          C * 
God’s re-cre-a-tion of the new day!
