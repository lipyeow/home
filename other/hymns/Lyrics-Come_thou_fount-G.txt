1. Come, thou Fount of every blessing,
        C                 G
tune my heart to sing thy grace;
           G            D
streams of mercy, never ceasing,
         C                G
call for songs of loudest praise.
         G              Em
Teach me some melodious sonnet,
         C                G
sung by flaming tongues a-bove.
           G                 D
Praise the mount! I'm fixed upon it,
         C             G
mount of thy redeeming love.
 
          G           D
2. Here I raise my Ebenezer;
       C               G
hither by thy help I'm come;
      G                 D
and I hope, by thy good pleasure,
       C            G
safely to arrive at home.
      G                Em
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
          C                G
wandering from the fold of God;
       G              D
he, to rescue me from danger,
     C                  G
interposed his precious blood.
 
        G                 D
3. O to grace how great a debtor
      C                  G
daily I'm constrained to be!
        G                D
Let thy goodness, like a fetter,
        C                  G
bind my wandering heart to thee.
         G               Em
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
         C               G
prone to leave the God I love;
          G                 D
here's my heart, O take and seal it,
        C               G
seal it for thy courts above.
