1. Sweet hour of prayer, Sweet hour of prayer,
     C        *      G        *
That calls me from a world of care,
    C       *     F         *
And bids me at my Fa-ther’s throne,
     C      *         G      C
Make all my wants and wishes known
   C        F      C         *
In sea-sons of dis-tress and grief,
   C        F     C        G7
My soul has often found re-lief,
    C     *         F         *
And oft escaped the tempter’s snare,
   C     *           G       C
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer.

         C       *             F       *
2. Sweet hour of prayer, Sweet hour of prayer,
    C      *         G       *
the joys I feel, the bliss I share 
   C           *       F       *
of those whose anxious spirits burn 
     C        *         G     C
with strong desires for thy return! 
     C      F      C      *
With such I hasten to the place 
      C      F      C         G7
where God my Savior shows his face, 
    C      *       F       *
and gladly take my station there, 
    C        *           G       C
and wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer! 

         C       *             F       *
3. Sweet hour of prayer, Sweet hour of prayer,
    C           *     G       *
Thy wings shall my pe-ti-tion bear
   C         *         F         *
To him whose truth and faith-ful-ness
   C        *        G7      C
En-gage the wait-ing soul to bless
    C        F       C        *
And since he bids me seek his face,
  C         F         C         G7
Believe his word, and trust his grace,
     C       C      F      *
I’ll cast on him my ev-ery care,
    C        *           G       C
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.
