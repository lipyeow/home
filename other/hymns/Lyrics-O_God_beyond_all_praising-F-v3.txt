its fragile bloom surrender
Am   Bb     *    C    F   *
to you, the Lord Most High;

but hidden from all nature
F    C *    F       Bb  *
the eternal seed is sown--
Bb     Dm  *    C      F  *
though small in mortal stature,
F  Bb       *  *   C   *
to heaven's garden grown:

for Christ, your gift from heaven,

from death has set us free,

and we through him are given
Am  Bb    *  C F *
the final victory.

Am Bb      *    C  Dm  *
accept the love we bring,

that we who know your favor
Am  Bb        *  C   F   *
may serve you as our King;

F   C *     Dm    C  *
and whether our tomorrows
F  C  *        F       Bb  *
be filled with good or ill,
Bb    Dm *    C           F  *
we'll triumph through our sorrows
F   Bb      *     *   C   *
and rise to bless you still:

F  Bb*    C       F  *
to marvel at your beauty
Am  Bb    *  C    Dm  *
and glory in your ways,
F   Bb*    C      F  *
and make a joyful duty
Am  Bb   *    C  F  *
our sacrifice of praise.
