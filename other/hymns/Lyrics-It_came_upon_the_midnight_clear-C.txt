It came u-pon a midnight clear that glorious song of old
     C      F       C        *        F           G        C  *
From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
      E      *           Am      *        G            D        G  *
Peace on the earth, good will to men from heaven's all gracious King
    C        F      C         *       F        G      C  *
The world in solemn stillness lay, to hear the angels sing


      C           F      C          *         F        D       G  *
Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurled,
    C           F        C     *           F       G     C   *
And still their heavenly music floats o'er all the weary world  
 E        *       Am    *            G       D        G  *
Above its sad and lowly plains, they bend on hovering wing;
    C    F        C     *          F       G      C  *
And ever o'er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing.


  C     F            C        *          F         D       G  *
O ye, beneath life's crushing load whose forms are bending low,
    C     F        C        *        F       G         C  *
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
     E        *        Am     *          G       D      G  *
Look now! for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing;
  C      F        C     *        F        G      C  *  
O rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing


    C       F        C         *     F        D       G *
For lo! The days are hastening on by prophets seen of old
     C        F     C        *           F        G        C  *
When with the e-ver circling years shall come the time foretold
     E           *     Am      *         G       D         G  *
When peace shall cover all the earth its ancient splendors fling
    C        F           C        *          F       G      C  *
And the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing!
