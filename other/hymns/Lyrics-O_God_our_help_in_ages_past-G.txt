1 O God, our help in ages past,
      Em         A           D            
our hope for years to come,
      G         D           Em      B7 
our shelter from the stormy blast, 
      C      D       G
and our eternal home;

2 under the shadow of your throne 
your saints have dwelt secure. 
Sufficient is your arm alone, 
and our defense is sure.

3 Before the hills in order stood, 
or earth received its frame,
from everlasting you are God, 
to endless years the same.

4 A thousand ages in your sight 
are like an evening gone, 
short as the watch that ends the night 
before the rising sun.

5 Time, like an ever-rolling stream, 
soon bears us all away. 
We fly forgotten, as a dream 
dies at the opâ€™ning day.

6 O God, our help in ages past, 
our hope for years to come,
still be our guard while troubles last, 
and our eternal home.
