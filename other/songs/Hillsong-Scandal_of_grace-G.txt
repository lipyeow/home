G                    *
Grace, what have you done?
C                       G
Murdered for me on that cross
  G                   *
Accused in absence of wrong
   C                       G 
My sin washed away in your blood


    D                        Em
Too much to make sense of it all
    D                           Em
I know that your love breaks my fall
    D                     Em
The scandal of grace, you died in my place
      C
So my soul will live

         G
Oh to be like you
G                       D
Give all I have just to know you
D                       Em
Jesus, there's no one besides you
  C                    G
Forever the hope in my heart

G                    *
Death, where is your sting?
     C                      G
Your power is as dead as my sin
    G                      G     
The cross has taught me to live
   C                      G
In mercy, my heart now to sing


    D                         Em
The day and its trouble shall come
    D                         Em
I know that your strength is enough
    D                     Em
The scandal of grace, you died in my place
      C
So my soul will live

         G
Oh to be like you
G                       D
Give all I have just to know you
D                       Em
Jesus, there's no one besides you
  C                    G
Forever the hope in my heart

         G
And it's all because of you, Jesus
     D
It's all because of you, Jesus
     Em
It's all because of your love
       C
And my soul will live

         G
Oh to be like you
G                       D
Give all I have just to know you
D                       Em
Jesus, there's no one besides you
  C                    G
Forever the hope in my heart
